# AltoidVideoGame
-This is a project that involved building an 8 bit video game that can fit inside of an Altoids can  
-It currently has the capability to move the player with a joystick and has two programmable buttons  
-I also created a game maker in python to create/edit sprites and assign predefined behavior
